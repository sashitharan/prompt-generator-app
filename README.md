## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
cd prompt-generator-app
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## How It Works

The app is designed based on understanding how AI agents (like me) process prompts:

1. **Parse & Understand**: AI analyzes your prompt structure
2. **Identify Context**: Context helps determine relevant approaches
3. **Apply Constraints**: Specific requirements guide response format
4. **Generate Response**: AI combines everything to provide the answer

### Key Principles for Better Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts lead to vague answers
2. **Provide Context**: Background information helps AI understand your situation
3. **Structure Your Request**: Organize complex requests clearly
4. **Include Examples**: Examples show exactly what format you want
5. **Specify Constraints**: Tell AI about limitations, preferences, requirements
6. **Iterate and Refine**: Start broad, then narrow down based on responses
